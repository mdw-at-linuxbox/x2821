NOTES.x2821
	notes on 2821.
ccc9.v
	ebcdic -> holes
	if/boolean based on code structure
ccc12.v
	holes -> ebcdic
	if/boolean based on code structure
ccc13.v
	holes -> ebcdic
	if/boolean based on code structure
	combinational output version
ccc18.v
	holes -> ebcdic
	ald logic
	pure combinational version
d132x5.v
	decode dual dec+100s to 1 of 132 bits.  direct decode, just the decoder
dec2bin1.v
	dual 2 of 5 + hundreds -> binary address conversion
decade6.v
	decade counter (2 of 5); with clear=set0, edge sensitive.
decade7.v
	decade counter (2 of 5); with set0 set9, edge sensitive.
decade12.v
	decade counter (2 of 5); with clear=set0, ac advance but dc sets
decade14.v
	decade counter (2 of 5); for prt: set6 set3 set0
decchk1.v
	decade 2 of 5 validation: are exactly 2 bits 1?
delay1.v
	configurable delay line; shift signal in time.
delay2.v
	configurable delay line; shorten signal (match ibm's aqq).
docount1.v
	double shift register: count 1 to 12 by shifting.
dodecode3.v
	decode 1 of 12 channel to 4-bit binary value (1-12); non-priority (gigo)
e2bcd1.v
	ebcdic to "bcd"=printer chain code
latch1.v
	latch for cons2150
latch2.v
	edge sensitive latch for 2821.
latch3.v
	faster output latch for 2821.
rlim4.v
	rate limiter; simplified low prec fixed point.
sim1403x3
	simulate 1403 timing pulses, carriage motor, hammers
ss1.v
	single shot - not quite ibm function
ss2.v
	single shot - cons2150
trigger2.v
	improved "adc" emulator does not need i_rst
trigger3.v
	ibm trigger with dual set, dual reset extenders
x2821.v
	2821 control unit for 1403 printer and 2540 card reader punch
pdetect1.v
	edge detect
x2821_tb.v
	test card punch logic
x2821a_tb.v
	test card reader logic
x2821b_tb.v
	test printer logic
x2821.ys
	make dot output - large and unreadable
sim2540x1.v
	simulate card read punch
